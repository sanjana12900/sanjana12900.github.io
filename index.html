    <h1>Sanjana Sinha</h1>
    <p> My name is Sanjana Sinha and I am a Junior at Rutgers University double majoring in Supply Chain Management
        and Business Analytics Information Technology. From classes Iâ€™ve taken at Rutgers and past work experience,
        I have acquired advanced skills in Excel and Microsoft Office as well as data visualization tools
        like Tableau and database management systems like Access.
        This past fall semester, I was a Project Management Analytics Intern
        where I learned and used tools such as PowerBI to track tasks, see if any resources were needed,
        measure risks as well as report research metrics. With these metrics,
        I helped our cross-functional teams understand their areas better, and measure progress against the goals
        they had which led them to perform better. On-campus, I have been a Mentor for Freshman and
        the Historian for Phi Beta Lambda, a professional development organization at Rutgers where I was driven to
        market our club out to Rutgers students. I have also been a Brand Ambassador where I leveraged my
        analytical skills to produce the highest amount of views on social media platforms possible based on
        specific target markets. I have also had the opportunity to do a case study last summer on ASOS,
        an online fashion company where I looked in-depth into their supply chain problems they had and identified trends,
        and performed data analysis to see what could be possible solutions to their company.
        I look forward to keep learning and expanding my knowledge about technology!

        In my class, Relational Databases and Web Applications, we were given a project where we have to
        create a dynamic visualization of employment statistics from the U.S.
        Department of Labor Statistic using ChartJS!
